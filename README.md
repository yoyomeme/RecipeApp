# RecipeApp
 An app for you to share your secret recipes~

Welcome to RecipeApp, a comprehensive iOS application designed to showcase a variety of recipes, allowing users to browse, add, edit, and delete recipes. This personal project aims to demonstrate my proficiency in iOS development, adherence to Apple's Human Interface Guidelines, and implementation of modern app development practices.
Features

To get start:
Clone the Repository: Clone this repository to your local machine to get started with the project.

Install Dependencies: Run pod install from the terminal in the project directory to install any third-party libraries.
Run the App: Select an iOS simulator or connect an iOS device and run the app using Xcode.


Language: Developed using Swift, leveraging modern language features for clean and efficient code.
Data Model: Utilizes an XML file (recipetypes.xml) to define recipe types, which populate a UIPickerView control for recipe categorization.

Architecture: Adopts the MVVM architecture pattern for clean and maintainable code.
Authentication: Features a login and logout system with session persistency until logout, enhancing app security.
Networking: Includes an API layer to fetch data from online or self-hosted sources, showcasing the app's ability to interact with external data.
Dependency Injection: Implements dependency injection using the Swinject library for improved modularity, reusability, maintainability, and scalability.
